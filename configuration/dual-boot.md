# Dual Boot

It is technically possible to dual-boot LibreELEC alongside an existing Windows or Linux installation, but the installation process is complex and less experienced users are prone to mistakes that result in their main Desktop OS and personal data being wiped from the hard drive. LibreELEC installers assume a dedicated disk target and cannot install into a spare partition or free space on the same drive that boots the Desktop OS. For this reason the project staff do not encourage or support dual-boot configurations. If you choose to attempt one and things go wrong, you were warned!
