# Introduction

LibreELEC is a minimalist 'Just enough OS' Linux distribution for running [Kodi](https://kodi.tv). Our documentation can help you install and configure LibreELEC to run Kodi, or develop and build installation images using our buildsystem.

Documentation is authored and maintained by LibreELEC users. If you see something is incorrect or missing please click the GitBook link below to join our documentation team. The GitBook online app makes changing documentation simple, with your changes sent directly to our [documentation repo on GitHub](https://github.com/LibreELEC/documentation) as a pull-request that project staff can review and merge.
