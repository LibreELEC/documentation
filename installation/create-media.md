# Create Media

The “LibreELEC USB-SD Creator” app helps you choose and download the latest image for your HTPC device and create bootable USB or SD Card media. The tool is available for Windows 7 and newer, macOS 10.9 and newer, and Ubuntu Linux 32/64 bit (and should also work on other Debian derivatives).

* [LibreELEC.USB-SD.Creator.Win32.exe](https://releases.libreelec.tv/LibreELEC.USB-SD.Creator.Win32.exe)
* [LibreELEC.USB-SD.Creator.macOS.dmg](https://releases.libreelec.tv/LibreELEC.USB-SD.Creator.macOS.dmg)
* [LibreELEC.USB-SD.Creator.Linux-32bit.bin](https://releases.libreelec.tv/LibreELEC.USB-SD.Creator.Linux-32bit.bin)
* [LibreELEC.USB-SD.Creator.Linux-64bit.bin](https://releases.libreelec.tv/LibreELEC.USB-SD.Creator.Linux-64bit.bin)

## Step 1

Choose the LibreELEC image and the app will show the latest stable release, e.g.

* Generic x86\_64 - LibreELEC-Generic.x86\_64-9.2.6.img.gz
* RaspberryPi 0/1 - LibreELEC-RPi.arm-9.2.6.img.gz
* RaspberryPi 2/3 - LibreELEC-RPi2.arm-9.2.6.img.gz
* RaspberryPi 4 - LibreELEC-RPi4.arm-9.2.6.img.gz

If you check 'Show all' the list also shows older stable releases and current Alpha (x.90.xxx) or Beta (x.95.0) releases.

## Step 2

After selecting the LibreELEC image and version click the `Download` button. This will prompt you to select a folder to download to. You can also select a previously downloaded image file on your machine for installation. Hit the `Select file` button and browse your computer for the .img.gz file, or drag/drop the file on the app GUI.

## Step 3

Select the USB stick or SD card to write the image onto. Click the refresh button if the removable device is not listed. Note: **ALL DATA ON THE TARGET DEVICE WILL BE OVERWRITTEN** so please ensure there is no important data on it!

## Step 4

After selecting an image and target device the `Write` button is available. Click it to write the image. Once the progress bar reaches 100% and shows `Writing done!` you can exit the app, eject the USB or SD media, and boot your device to install LibreELEC.
