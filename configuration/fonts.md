# Fonts

Kodi includes a default font that supports a large number of languages in a reasonable file size. It does not support all languages as this would require a font file larger than a LibreELEC image!

If you see blank squares for titles and filenames instead of redable text - You need to add a custom Arial True-Type (.ttf) font that supports the missing language characters and glyphs.

In LibreELEC create `/storage/.kodi/userspace/Fonts/` (note the capital F) and place an Arial based font in the folder, e.g. `/storage/.kodi/userspace/Fonts/Arial.ttf` - after rebooting or restarting Kodi the font can be selected in Kodi Settings > Interface > Skin > Fonts.
